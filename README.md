# Course Follow-Along – Project Based on Mehmet Ozkaya's Repository

This repository contains the source code from the course **"Develop Microservices on .NET 8"**, taught by [Mehmet Ozkaya](https://github.com/[original-repo-link]).

The course covers ASP.NET Web API, Docker, RabbitMQ, MassTransit, gRPC, Yarp Gateway, Redis, and SQL Server.

I created this repository as part of my learning process by following along with the course. No modifications have been made to the original code.
